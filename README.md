# Remote_Phonebook
In this project ,we have to make a setup for a remote phonebook. The process starts by establishing a connection between the client and the server.User is then authenticated by the use of the pre registered user data stored in an appropriate data structure.  The server maintains a concurrency control for all its clients with proper security and protection. The client would ask authentication from the server and after authentication they would remain in the public group by default. There would be three types of access categories for the user: anonymous, authenticated and admin authenticated. For an anonymous client, the server should support a virtual user with the name anonymous to add contact to a public group only without any password. All the authenticated users should be allowed to add, view and delete contact from the phone directory for the group they belong to. They should view the content of public groups. Users with authenticated admin access can access any contact in addition to add, remove group to phone directory.
